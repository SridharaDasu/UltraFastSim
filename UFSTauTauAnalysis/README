Package for Analysis of UltraFastSim Data to reconstruct TauTau

You should have already got UltraFastSim checked out.  You then
do the following once to set yourself up:
    cd ~/CMSSW_5_3_10_patch1
    cvs -d /afs/hep.wisc.edu/cms/CVSRepository co UFSTauTauAnalysis
    cd UFSTauTauAnalysis
    make

Upon future login:
    cd ~/CMSSW_5_3_10_patch1
    cd UFSTauTauAnalysis
    cmsenv

When changes are made to the code:
    make

To run the analysis:

    ./analyzeData
    histos.root
    ../hfac-h.root
    EOF

that gets you a root file with histograms made from the
UFS data.  You can list a bunch of files, that is why
the program interface is a bit crazy.  We can clean 
this up later.  hfac-h.root is just an example file
that you created earlier in UltraFastSim.
